Title: Mixture Nested Effects Models
Version: 1.5.15
Author: Martin Pirkl

Description: Mixture Nested Effects Models (mnem) is an extension of Nested Effects Models and allows for the analysis of single cell perturbation data provided by methods like Perturb-Seq (Dixit et al., 2016) or Crop-Seq (Datlinger et al., 2017). In those experiments each of many cells is perturbed by a knock-down of a specific gene, i.e. several cells are perturbed by a knock-down of gene A, several by a knock-down of gene B, ... and so forth. The observed read-out has to be multi-trait and in the case of the Perturb-/Crop-Seq gene are expression profiles for each cell. mnem uses a mixture model to simultaneously cluster the cell population into k clusters and and infer k networks causally linking the perturbed genes for each cluster. The mixture components are inferred via an expectation maximization algorithm.
